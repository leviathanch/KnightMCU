# The Knight coprocessor v1

![Knight Industries Co-Process](knight.png)

I can't call it the Knight Industries One Co-Processor, because Knight Industries is
an actual company in New York, and the chess horse logo is also trade marked by them,
so I settled on naming it Knight Co-Processor, haha.

Like with all the AI hype, even if someone would tell me totally hystherically about
SkyNet, all I'd do is go and ask "Hey SkyNet! Can you build me KITT?", and that's
essentially what I've done with Baby AGI here.

The requirement from the eFabless challenge (https://efabless.com/ai-generated-design-contest)
was that the Verilog code must be generated by AI, but of course it's impossible to have
an AI generate all the code in a proper synthesizable manner on its own, I mean think
about what the implications would be if this would have actually worked!
That would mean, that GPT3/4 would already be able to understand itself and procreate
and to even redesign itself!
That would be the capability of machines to procreate and evolve, which would mean
that OpenAI's infrastructure would be eligible to civil rights because it would qualify
as a living being!

Anyway, I marked and copied all the Verilog code and so out of the 24MB of output and
organized it in the folders here.

It is based on the 24MB large output of Baby AGI, which I have let run for two days.
You can download it with wget and look at it with the less command or so.

Enjoy!
